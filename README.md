# Silent Failure in React Fetch Request
This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications: silent failure of asynchronous fetch requests.  The provided `MyComponent` attempts to fetch data from an API endpoint. However, it lacks robust error handling for network issues and non-200 HTTP status codes. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficulty in debugging.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code.  `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the corrected code with comprehensive error handling.

## Problem
The primary issue lies in the lack of thorough error handling within the `fetchData` function's `try...catch` block. The `fetch` function can reject due to network errors which aren't handled correctly and result in an unexpected application state.

## Solution
The solution involves improving the error handling within the `try...catch` block and more explicitly handling various response scenarios from the server (non 2xx status codes).
